\subsection{Baseline LLM Evaluation and Stability}

We evaluate baseline LLM performance using standardized prompts that simulate VC decision-making scenarios. However, we observe substantial performance variability in LLM outputs across identical experimental conditions. For instance, GPT-4o evaluated on the same 10\% success dataset showed accuracy ranging from 11.2\% to 21.4\% (coefficient of variation = 44.2\%) and prediction bias ratios varying from 7.63 to 81.67 (CV = 117.1\%) across two independent runs.

This instability highlights a critical limitation of vanilla LLM approaches for high-stakes decision-making: \textit{inconsistent performance under identical conditions}. To address this, we report averaged metrics with standard deviations where multiple runs are available, and emphasize that framework stability is an additional advantage of structured approaches like SSFF over direct LLM prompting.

## 2. **Results Section Addition**

### **Baseline Performance Variability** (Insert in baseline results discussion)

```latex
Notably, baseline LLM approaches exhibit concerning performance variability across runs. GPT-4o's accuracy on identical 10\% success datasets ranged from 11.2\% to 21.4\%, while prediction bias ratios varied nearly 10-fold (7.63 to 81.67). This instability suggests that vanilla LLM approaches lack the consistency required for reliable VC decision support, providing additional motivation for structured frameworks like SSFF that demonstrate more stable performance across evaluations.

## 3. **Discussion Section Addition**

### **Implications of LLM Instability** (Insert in limitations/implications)

```latex
\subsubsection{LLM Stability and Practical Deployment}

Our findings reveal that baseline LLM approaches suffer from both systematic bias (over-prediction) and performance instability. The observed variability in GPT-4o results (CV=44.2\% for accuracy) raises serious concerns about deploying vanilla LLMs for critical business decisions. This instability likely stems from:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stochastic sampling} in autoregressive generation
    \item \textbf{Prompt sensitivity} to minor contextual variations
    \item \textbf{Model uncertainty} in ambiguous startup evaluation scenarios
\end{enumerate}

In contrast, SSFF's structured approach with explicit reasoning steps and traditional ML components provides more consistent performance, crucial for real-world VC applications where reliability is paramount.

## 5. **Abstract/Introduction Edits**

### **Updated Abstract Hook** (Replace existing abstract opening)

```latex
Evaluating startups at inception remains notoriously challenging, with recent large language models (LLMs) offering promising but unstable automation potential. While vanilla LLM approaches show severe over-prediction bias and concerning performance variability across identical conditions, structured multi-agent systems present opportunities for more reliable startup success forecasting.
```

### **Introduction Addition** (Insert after discussing LLM limitations)

```latex
Moreover, our preliminary experiments reveal that vanilla LLM approaches suffer from both systematic over-prediction bias and substantial performance instability. For instance, GPT-4o's accuracy on identical datasets varied by 91\% across runs, demonstrating that direct LLM prompting lacks the consistency required for high-stakes VC decisions.
```

## 6. **Future Work Section**

### **Stability and Ensemble Methods**

```latex
Future research should address LLM instability through ensemble methods, multiple-run averaging, and uncertainty quantification. Investigating the sources of performance variability—whether from stochastic sampling, prompt engineering, or model uncertainty—could inform more robust deployment strategies for AI-assisted venture capital decision-making.
